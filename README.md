Compulsory Assignment

During week 10 we were given an assignemnt to work and use state based and change-based approaches.

In both of our approaches we decided to commit to non-destructive approach. The reason for that was mainly because we wanted safely preserve changed data, to have an easier revert and most importantly to minimze risk and downtime.
